- 2nd Phase (22 Aug 2023):
I improve my project and this time i use a tkinter for UI. But still my project is not publically available it means till 22 August 2023 deployment is not done.

- 3rd Phase (22 Sep 2023):
I improve my project and deploy it on streamlit, still in this phase of my project i face a problem , the problem is .py file is locally run/work perfectly but after deployment it gives me an error 
(ImportError libGL.so.1 cannot open shared object file No such file or directory)
and then after some search and teacher help i resolve this problem and then i deploy my project Facial Analysis App on streamlit app.
